## DISCLAIMER : 
This dashboard helps analyzing Road accident for 2021 to 2022 . It help us to analyze how many casualties happens in city , how many vehicle involved in it, Accident severity, some other stuffs .

Further, people who easily figure out that made the dashboard with charts . 

## DATA CLEANING :
 
Sometime dataset contains human errors , spelling mistake , missing values , etc. Those things having this dataset , which is not able to identified proper report . Then all of data analyst aspirants used this method as a first step.

In action ,I had taken first step that Data cleaning . I have check out some spelling mistake , which will be occuring some values of other value . So I have cleaned through find and replace option.

## DATA PROCESSING:
 
This process handled such as adopted formulas , customized columns and etc . It will help to proper visualization.

In Process , According to client requirement has been monthly trend. so I have insert 2 column then found month and year from accident date through Text function . In case , i have adopted Text Function. 

## DATA ANALYZING & DATA VISUALIZATION :

In this process aspirants who will be using the aggregation functions , build a pivot tables for proper calculation and make a proper charts by pivot tables 

In Action handled Data analysing and Data viusualizing . These both process done with Pivot Tables.

According to client Requirements, i have made a Primary KPI'S .
  - Step 1 : Create a Pivot Table
  - Step 2 : Find Total Casualties for first Primary KPI
  - Step 3 : According to second primary KPI , where extract each total value of accident severity from pivot table 
  - Step 4 : Calculating each accident severity vs Others 
  - Step 5 : calculating percentage value each accident severity and combined another accident severity
  - Step 6 : Make sure donut charts for each accident severity through it's percentage values
  - Step 7 : Consolidated some vehicle type in particular vehicle type using Fields,items & sets 
  - Step 8 : Extract only car values from pivot table, Calculate percentage values and make sure donut charts for car causualties.

According to client Requirements, will make some Secondary KPI'S 
  - Step 1 : Extract each vehicle type value from consolidated vehicle type values
  - Step 2 : Make sure KPI card for each vehicle type value 
  - Step 3 : Create pivot table monthly trend where have to filter year wise total casualties and extract values for each year from pivot table
  - Step 4 : Make a line chart by year wise total casualties.

  - Step 5 : Likewise, create another sheet pivot table for road type where make a bar chart by road type wise casualties value

  - Step 6 : Likewise, create another sheet pivot table for road surface conditions where make a tree map by road surface conditions values

  - Step 7 : Likewise, create another sheet pivot table for urban_rural_area and light conditions where make a each donut charts by urban_rural_area and light conditions.

  - Step 8 : Finally , create a filter panel which will be using accident date timeline. Insert slicer for urban_rural Area

## REPORT/DASHBOARD :

In case , Insert to created primary KPI'S and secondary KPI'S in formatted sheet.
Then format to each KPI'S as well and Insert to pictures and icons in Dashboard .
Finally iterate to Filter panel with KPI'S and connect to hyperlink with icons.
